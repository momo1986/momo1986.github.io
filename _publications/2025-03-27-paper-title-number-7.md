excerpt: 'Image classifiers often degrade in performance when test images differ significantly from the training distribution due to real-world image corruptions. Frequency-based augmentations can be used to address this issue, but existing methods excel against corruptions caused by noise and blur while struggling with those caused by contrast and fog. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel image augmentation method grounded in a new perspective of relative spectral differences.'
