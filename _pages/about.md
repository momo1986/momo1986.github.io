Dr. Jun Yan's personal website
Dr. Jun Yan is a scholar who focuses on trusted AI. He is full of academic enthusiasm and studies scientific problems facing industrial applications and the essence of intelligence.

**Three core problems**

**1. With the evolution of the law of scale, humanity is poised to enter the era of general artificial intelligence. How can we explain and verify the safety of large-scale AI systems from a fundamental theoretical perspective?**

**2. At the methodological level, how to address the governance challenges posed by the increasing robustness and privacy risks of artificial intelligence from the perspective of integrated attack and defense?**

**3. In the era of embodied intelligence, with the increasing integration and breakthroughs of artificial intelligence technology in physical entities, how can we construct a generalizable and trustworthy robot system?**
